## Retail Store Simulation

Description
  A retail store simulation project utilizing the Factory Design Pattern to manage a shopping cart system. Customers can add tools and groceries to their carts, calculate total costs, and generate purchase reports. The project demonstrates clean and extensible software architecture through object-oriented principles, allowing for easy addition of new products without modifying existing code.

## Features
  Customers can purchase tools and groceries.
  The Factory Design Pattern is used for tool and grocery creation.
  Cart system for calculating total cost and managing items.
  Adheres to principles like the Open/Closed Principle for extensibility.

##Design Patterns Used--
  Factory Design Pattern: Used to create tools and groceries dynamically based on user input.
  Composition: Employed in the structure of the cart to handle different item types (tools and groceries).
  Follows Open/Closed Principle for easy extension of functionality.
